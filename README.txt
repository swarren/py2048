This is an implementation of the game "2048" that's quite popular right now.
For some reason, I felt like implementing it in Python.

Possible TODO:
* The code in apply_move() could probably be cleaned up.
* Colorized terminal output.
* Command-line options for board size, target tile.
* Implement game logic as a module, so different UI can be wrapped
  around it, e.g. wxPython, text-mode, ...
* Unit tests.
* Sound.
* 3-D or n-D boards.
* Non-rectilinear board (e.g. hexagonal).
* getch() on Windows?
